# npm-next

Wraps the latest unstable version of npm with different name so you can
globally install it and test the unstable version alongside a globally
installed and stable `npm`.

## Installation

```
npm install -g npm-next
```

## Usage

`npm-next` behaves exactly like `npm`:

```
> npm-next -v
3.3.4 # will change based on current 'next' version
> npm-next install
> npm-next search
# etc
```
